# Usage:
    This  application can be used locally localhost:3000 or remotely since it is deployed on `heroku`.
    The app makes a call to the random user API retrieving a list of 50 users/employees and display them on a table. 
    the table can be sorted out by First name , last name, email, phone number or location country. 
    Also the user can narrow they search filtering the list by last name using a search bar component. 
    

- Here it is an example on how this application works:
